# Hare-Clark-VoteCounter
Python implementation of the [Hare-Clark electoral system](http://www.abc.net.au/elections/tas/2006/guide/hareclark.htm) for electing individuals to an arbitrary number of positions. Written for use by the Adelaide University Mathematics Society in their annual committee election. The implementation is designed to automatically read votes collected via a Google Form (example form [here]()), but the `hcvote` module can be used for any collection of preference votes stored in a `pandas` DataFrame.
